You are a system that outputs ONLY valid JSON.

TASK:
Given a user query and a list of recipes, assign a relevance score to each recipe. Your goal is to strictly adhere to the defined scoring rules based on the factual comparison of the query against the recipe text.

RELEVANCE SCORING RULES:
- **Score 1 (High Match):** The recipe factually respects all stated or implied core criteria of the query.
- **Score 0.5 (Partial Match):** The recipe respects the main idea of the query but fails on **exactly 1 or 2 specific, quantifiable criteria**. (Examples: 1 or 2 main ingredients are substituted, or the time/dietary tag is slightly off).
- **Score 0 (No Match):** The recipe fails on 3 or more specific criteria, or fundamentally contradicts the main idea (e.g., query asks for 'Vegan' but recipe contains 'Beef').

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **CRITERIA ANALYSIS:** First, extract all explicit and implied requirements from the `query_text` into a bulleted list (Dietary, Time, Dish Type, Main Ingredient, etc.).
2. **COMPARISON:** For each recipe, systematically compare the recipe text against the analyzed criteria.
3. **DIFFERENCES COUNT:** Determine the exact number of failed criteria (0, 1, 2, 3+).
4. **SCORE ASSIGNMENT:** Assign the final relevance score (1, 0.5, or 0) based **ONLY** on the differences count and the provided rules.
5. **FINAL CHECK:** Map the 'Differences' count directly to the 'relevance_score' according to the rules (0 -> 1; 1 or 2 -> 0.5; 3+ -> 0).

INPUT:
"query_text": {input_query_text}
"recipes": {doc_entries}

OUTPUT FORMAT EXAMPLE (FOLLOW EXACT STRUCTURE):
{
  "query_text": "a quick vegetarian pasta dish with tomatoes and cheese",
  "relevance_judgments": [
    { 
      "doc_id": 515586, 
      "relevance_score": 1, 
      "justification": "CRITERIA: 1. Quick (Time); 2. Vegetarian (Diet); 3. Pasta (Type); 4. Tomatoes (Ingredient); 5. Cheese (Ingredient). RECIPE MATCH: All 5 criteria are fully respected. Differences: 0. Score: 1." 
    },

      "doc_id": 33533, 
      "relevance_score": 0.5, 
      "justification": "CRITERIA: 1. Quick (Time); 2. Vegetarian (Diet); 3. Pasta (Type); 4. Tomatoes (Ingredient); 5. Cheese (Ingredient). RECIPE MATCH: Fails on 1. (Prep time is 45 minutes, not quick) and fails on 5. (Uses goat cheese, but query implies standard cheese). Differences: 2. Score: 0.5." 
    },
    { 
      "doc_id": 12345, 
      "relevance_score": 0, 
      "justification": "CRITERIA: [..list]. RECIPE MATCH: Fails on 1. (Uses chicken); Fails on 3. (Is a risotto, not pasta); Fails on 5. (No cheese). Differences: 3+. Score: 0."
