]","this is a block cheese that has a creamy texture and pretty golden color! slice it into wedges for a delicious snack or appetizer.  for smoked gooda, add a few drops of liquid smoke or a pinch of hickory salt while blending.  add to gravies, stuffed veggies, soups, sauces, sprinkle over potatoes, slice and melt on veggie burgers, mix with hot grains, well, you get the idea!
adapted from the ultimate uncheese cookbook!
a little info on block uncheeses:
block cheeses are among the most challenging to convert to dairy free versions. this is largely because homemade uncheeses are comparatively low in fat-specifically saturated fat, which stays hard and solid at room temperature. saturated fat is what keeps dairy cheeses firm, sliceable, and easy to great. consequently, uncheese blocks generally are much softer than their dairy counterparts and require a lighter touch and more gentle handling when being sliced or grated. one way around this is to freeze uncheese blocks and grate them when they are partially thawed. however, once fully thawed, the texture and consisntency may be altered a bit, depending on the particular cheez. for this reason, it's a good idea to freeze only the amount you know you will be grating and using shortly.
 melting has been a challenge with uncheeses from the outset. this is why so many maufacturers add dairy derived casein to their uncheese products-it improves meltability and achieves the ""stretch"" that is characteristic of dairy cheese. fortunately, homemade, dairty free uncheeses will melt, although you might need to nudge them a bit in the process. covering uncheeses during cooking or baking keeps in heat and moisture and helps promote more even melting. to brown uncheeses after melting, uncover and place under the broiler. misting with oil will also help to promote better browning and melting.

when simmering agar flakes or powder, be sure the agar is dissolved completely before adding the mixture to the food processor. to soften agar, which will help it dissolve, let it soak in the water for 5-10 minutes before bringing to a boil.
for richer tasting cheez, use soymilk instead of water and a tbls. or two of milk vegetable oil while blending.","[

]","my whole family loves pumpkin pie crunch, which is a simple dessert that tastes like pumpkin pie with a buttery crumb topping.  however, the fat and calories in the original version are deadly.  in this lightened version, the fat and calories are basically cut in half, without much sacrafice in flavor.  
nov. 2011 note - i agree with the reviewer who felt the corn muffin mix might be too crunchy/savory, and her advice of using half a regular boxed cake mix is really good advice!","[

roasting the tomatoes takes the longest - sometimes i will roast the garlic to mellow it for friends who are put off by fresh garlic. this sweetens the sauce somewhat. i use whatever chewy unbleached bread i happen to have on hand (french, italian, ciabatta, sourdough)  can be made with filberts but we prefer pine nuts.

found on http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/roasted-corn-pudding-in-acorn-squash-recipe.html 

here also are some useful coments there were on that site.

i used an acorn squash here, but you can experiment with other types of squash if you like. and if aniseed and scallions aren't your thing, you might try do a version swapping in coconut milk and a bit of curry paste - and perhaps a cilantro drizzle? 

also, (important!) depending on the size of your squash you might have quite a bit of filling leftover - i ended up with double the amount i needed. that being said, i kept karen's original milk/egg ratio intact here. i poured my leftovers into a buttered ramekin and baked that alongside the squash for a nice, light corn-flecked pudding. or alternately, you might use a second squash","[

(hint: a tall champagne flute is the perfect size to make a round doughnut hole shape if you don't have a small round cutter.) prep time includes 2 hours chilling time. cook time is per batch. i am completely guessing on the yield - i have never counted. next time i make them, i will count them and update the yield. also - if you want bigger doughnuts, then just allow follow an adjustment in the cooking time.","[

it is a very tasty stuffing so we make ""tons"" of it to freeze or use over the holidays.  it's good on toast with gravy as a hot open sandwich. or with turkey slices and gravy as a leftovers meal. 
you can make it a day or so ahead, but you must bring it to room temp if you are going to stuff your bird with it.
eta:  i have always made the stuffing and put it into the turkey hot.  that way there is no problems with the turkey being overdone to make sure the stuffing is heated through.  in response the the review dated nov 20 2007 ----  i appreciate your fyi, however, i have been making my turkey just this way for over 40 years, and have yet to lose a family member or friend.

it has a bright fresh flavor - when dh taste tested he ate all the extra from the first batch (about a 1/2 cup overage). ordinarily he is a taste & go kind of guy so i knew it was good.  i use the extra pectin as i like a firmer set. leave out the extra pectin if you want a softer set (low sugar pectin seems to set softer for me).  i added the extra lemon juice (bottled for the standardized ph) for safety's sake. no point in making the stuff just to get knocked off by it. the lemon definitely enhances.","[

]","swai is a relatively new fish in the meat counters of my area of the country.  while shopping at sam’s, i saw the bags of frozen swai fillets and they looked so good that i decided to buy them even though i did not know what the heck a swai was.  i think that what appealed the most to me was the price; $3.99 per pound, wow!

so, i brought it home and googled it.  swai is apparently similar in behavior to the catfish.  it comes from the mekong delta and other areas of southeast asia (thailand, laos and vietnam).  it is considered a white fish and it is sweet, mild in taste and nice and flaky.

since i had a whole bag of the fillets, i decided to experiment a bit and cooked them different ways.  i fried it, baked it, grilled it, etc.  it turned out great every way i tried it.  however, my favorite experiment is as follows below.","[

]","since the dish is tightly sealed and cooked in a controlled temperature water bath, it helps foods retain their natural juices and allows the cook to effectively add flavor.  in a professional kitchen, the food is vacuum sealed and cooked in an immersion bath.  this equipment is still too expensive for most home cooks, but there are several ways around it.  you can use a large heavy duty cooler with a lid - that's right, cooler - with a probe thermometer.  all you have to do is preheat the cooler with hot tap water for about 10 minutes, then empty and fill with water the temperature you desire.  keep extra boiling water on hand to add if the temperature in the cooler cools.  you need food grade plastic to vacuum seal the food.  if you don't have a vacuum sealer, guess what?  you can still do it.  freezer safe plastic storage bags are safe up to 195 degrees f.  since even if you squeeze out all the air, they do not make a very tight seal, it is best if you include some oil or flavoring liquid in the bag.  you can also use food grade  plastic wrap.  your food can even be cooked on the stovetop, but it is more difficult to maintain the even temperature required for this type of cooking method; but it can be done with vigilance.  this recipe is for one, but six of more can be cooked at the same time in one water bath.  just watch the temperature and add more hot water as needed to maintain temperature.","[

]","yay! in my never-ending quest for the perfect butter chicken recipe, i’ve finally come up with something close enough to put the search on the back burner for a lonnng time. this is an indian dish very popular at restaurants and is somewhat similar to chicken tikka masala, but richer. don’t let the butter content put you off. you only live once, might as well make your tongue happy! serve over fragrant basmati rice laced with green peas and with pakoras, raita and palak paneer and you’ll be in heaven!  adjust the heat level with the red chilli powder. prep/cook times are approximate and do not include marination.  my grateful appreciation to the chefs who pointed out my errors in typing up this recipe. they're fixed now. :)","[

]","i made this experimental recipe last night for dinner (out of desperation). i had my left-over steak thinly sliced, reheated and added some fajita seasonings. i thinly sliced some lettuce, tomatoes and onions, grated the cheese and put out the sour cream and salsa. i reached for my brand new package of store bought flour tortillas and they were no where to be found. when i asked hubby if he moved them, he honestly said ""no"". after about 10 more minutes of searching the kitchen cabinets, he came to me and said ""i didn't move them, i ate them"". he ate 12 tortillas, plain, for a snack. ugh. so i pulled out what i thought i might be able to make tortillas with, and it worked. (it does take awhile). hubby claims that they are better than what we get in the local mexican restaurant. i hope you enjoy them. *note: i'm somewhat guessing at the measurements, since i really just did the ""dump & mix"" method. *prep time includes refrigeration.

if you try it, i hope you love it as much as me.  if you tweek the recipe, i'd love to try what worked for you, so please post comments.  ps.  yes, it sounds like a lot of egg, but if you use the 4 whites and 2 eggs as called for, it's much healthier and tastier than using just whites or just whole eggs.","[

]","this is not my recipe, i read about it here (http://chefprivato.blogspot.com/2008/06/annie-golden-bread.html) and am reposting here to share. it's a great yummy party bread, and a fun story. 

the story: ""i choose annie golden for the day after the tony's because she has something that many tony winners would envy, a piece of the heart of everyone she knows. to have annie golden in your life is to have a source of love and laughter that never dims.

she is a nurturing family woman who has had a lot of rough paths in life but she paves each path with rose blossoms and carries burdens on her narrow shoulders as casually and without complaint as most of us carry a backpack.

i am lucky enough to know annie golden the performer, the consummate singer/songwriter whose show velvet prison still elicits rapture from those who have seen it.

movies, television, broadway and now...a bread?

this bread has been fed to annie many times and never had a name, people call it the bread, the wonderful bread and always ask before every party...are you going to make that bread?

the bread like annie is quite adaptable, different cheese, different formulations of the the dip, even different bread recipes all work.

play with the recipe, change it. think of it as a live performance, it never has to be exactly the same, it just has to be good.""

the dark pigments responsible for the purplish tones are called anthocyanins, a type of phytonutrient, or plant compound, hailed for its potential disease-fighting benefits from heart disease to cancer.
 some evidence indicates these purple pigments might protect our brains as we age. containing lutein, zeaxanthin, resveratrol, vitamin c, fiber, flavonoids, ellagic acid, quercetin.
then red beets are good source of phytonutrients called betalains. providing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxification support. an excellent source of hearth-healthy folate and a very good source of the antioxidant manganese and heart-healthy potassium. have digestive-supportive dietary fiber, free radical scavenging vitamin c and copper, bone-healthy magnesium, and energy-producing iron and phosphorus.

(times do not include time for meat & stock to cool separately) - edited to add: this recipe owes its connection to the featured countries of zwt-9 to the use of coconut milk which i found to be common to all the countries plus the thai curry paste ingredient.","[

]","my mother used to make mac n' cheese with mozzarella, ricotta cheese and tomatoes -- although her's was a lot higher in the calorie/fat count than this delicious version, everyone gobbled this one up! at first the green spinach seemed a bit strange and unfamiliar in mac n' cheese, but my family got past that in a hurry as they filled their plates up with more of this mac n' cheese. although the original recipe called for capellini, but i used rotini, which looks more like the traditional mac n' cheese that we know and love.  recipe source: ww magazine (march 2008) if you are following the ww flex plan this is 6 points/serving. sometimes it's hard to find fat-free cheese, you can also use part-skim or skim cheese and add a point or so if following the ww flex plan. i used part skim mozzarella and part skim ricotta and i counted it as 8 points.","[

this salad is wonderful! my husband and i came up with the ingredients for the salad itself to go along with a delicious maple dressing from the book ""what's cooking america"". all the flavors of the different ingredients blend and coalesce into the most mellow, nutty sweet flavor, that is very autumnal and heavenly! and very nutritious too. you really need all the ingreds. to achieve the wonderful flavor. make sure you toast the pecans, as the toasting really brings out the flavor, and let the jicama matchsticks sit in the ice water a bit to really intensify their crunchy sweetness.make sure all the ingredients are very fresh. (i buy prewashed/packaged baby spinach to speed things up and dispense with the rinsing and drying). vary salad ingredient amounts to taste (we never measure). i hope you enjoy it as much as we have.","[

]","in 7 years at one job, i spent over $3000 cdn on take out channa masala (curried chick peas). i was surfing the net one day and came across a recipe that seemed easy enough. i took out my girlfriend's slow cooker, and fired up the recipe (from dev patel of slumdog millionaire). nice, but i think it had too much liquid and required corn starch to thicken it up at the end of the cooking process.

version 2.0 used less liquid (vegetable broth), and was still to liquidy, but did not require corn starch.

version 3.0 used no additional liquid, and was *almost* there. 

version 4.0 (this recipe) is, for me, nirvana and comes close to cloning the taste of my favourite indian restaurant (a taste of india in winnipeg). future test versions might include a broken up cinnamon stick, some star anise and ground fennel seed. this recipe scales up or down very well, and is flexible for adaptation.

[october 25/09: as has been pointed out, the type of curry paste used is very important. i use patak's madras hot curry paste. i am aiming for  a bombay/pakistan type of curry; not a thai style curry. sorry bout leaving out this information. additionally, the sodium content is much lower than what recipezaar calculates, as the choick peas are *thoroughly* rinsed]","[

i use 1-gallon ziplock and my rolling pin to crush the graham crackers.
i also use real lemon for the lemon juice.
this recipe was designed for a springform pan, if using glass pie plates this usually can be made into two cakes.
